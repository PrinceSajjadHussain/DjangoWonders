Elasticsearch-Kibana-Grafana-Load-Balancer
This project integrates a load balancer with Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Grafana to provide a robust logging and monitoring solution. It uses FastAPI for the load balancer, Elasticsearch for storing logs, Kibana for visualizing logs, and Grafana for monitoring metrics.

Overview
Load Balancer: A FastAPI application that distributes incoming HTTP requests across multiple backend servers using a round-robin approach.
Elasticsearch: Stores and indexes log data from the load balancer.
Kibana: Provides a web interface for visualizing and querying log data stored in Elasticsearch.
Grafana: Offers a powerful dashboard for monitoring metrics, which can be configured to pull data from Elasticsearch.
Components
1. FastAPI Load Balancer
The FastAPI-based load balancer forwards incoming requests to a pool of backend servers in a round-robin fashion. It also logs request and response details, including execution times and errors, to Elasticsearch.

Features:
Round-robin load balancing
Detailed logging with Elasticsearch integration
Middleware to log request and response details
Prometheus integration for monitoring metrics
2. Elasticsearch
Elasticsearch stores logs generated by the FastAPI load balancer. It allows for full-text search and analytics on the log data.

3. Kibana
Kibana provides a web-based UI to explore and visualize the log data stored in Elasticsearch. It allows you to create dashboards, perform searches, and analyze logs.

4. Grafana
Grafana is used for visualizing metrics. It integrates with Elasticsearch to provide real-time dashboards for monitoring metrics and logs.

Setup
Prerequisites
Docker
Docker Compose
Python 3.8 or higher
Elasticsearch 8.x
Kibana 8.x
Grafana 8.x
1. Running Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Grafana
You can use Docker Compose to set up Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Grafana. Create a docker-compose.yml file with the following content:

yaml
Copy code
version: '3.7'

services:
  elasticsearch:
    image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.4.0
    container_name: elasticsearch
    environment:
      - node.name=es01
      - cluster.name=es-cluster
      - discovery.type=single-node
      - ELASTIC_PASSWORD=your_elastic_password
    ports:
      - "9200:9200"
    networks:
      - es-net

  kibana:
    image: docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:8.4.0
    container_name: kibana
    environment:
      - ELASTICSEARCH_HOSTS=http://elasticsearch:9200
      - ELASTIC_PASSWORD=your_elastic_password
    ports:
      - "5601:5601"
    networks:
      - es-net

  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana:8.4.0
    container_name: grafana
    environment:
      - GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_grafana_password
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    networks:
      - es-net

networks:
  es-net:
    driver: bridge
Run the following command to start all services:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up
2. Running the FastAPI Load Balancer
Build the Docker Image:

Create a Dockerfile for the FastAPI load balancer:

Dockerfile
Copy code
# Base image for FastAPI
FROM python:3.8.0

# Set environment variables
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE 1
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1

# Create and set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements file and install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the application code
COPY . .

# Copy SSL certificate and key files to the container
COPY certfile.pem /app/certfile.pem
COPY keyfile.pem /app/keyfile.pem

# Expose the port FastAPI will run on
EXPOSE 7010

# Command to run the FastAPI application with SSL/TLS
CMD ["uvicorn", "load_balancer:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "7010", "--ssl-keyfile", "/app/keyfile.pem", "--ssl-certfile", "/app/certfile.pem", "--reload"]
Build and Run the Docker Container:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t fastapi-load-balancer .
docker run -d -p 7010:7010 --name load-balancer fastapi-load-balancer
Configuration
FastAPI Load Balancer Configuration
config.json: Define your backend servers in config.json:

json
Copy code
{
  "servers": [
    "http://backend1:8080",
    "http://backend2:8080"
  ]
}
Elasticsearch Configuration
setup_logging Function: Ensure the setup_logging function in your logging_setup.py script includes correct Elasticsearch credentials:

python
Copy code
logger = setup_logging(
    es_hosts='http://elasticsearch:9200',
    index_name='my_logs',
    es_user='elastic',
    es_password='your_elastic_password'
)
Accessing the Services
FastAPI Load Balancer: https://localhost:7010
Kibana: http://localhost:5601
Grafana: http://localhost:3000
Grafana Configuration
Add Elasticsearch Data Source:

Go to Grafana's web interface.
Navigate to Configuration > Data Sources.
Add a new data source and select Elasticsearch.
Set the URL to http://elasticsearch:9200 and configure the rest of the settings as needed.
Create Dashboards:

Create Grafana dashboards to visualize metrics and logs from Elasticsearch.
Troubleshooting
Ensure that all services are running properly by checking their respective logs.
Verify that Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Grafana are correctly configured and accessible.
If you encounter any issues with authentication, double-check your credentials and connection settings.
